/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has N hours.
 * Each game takes 20 minutes.
 * Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of games per hour is 60 / 20 = 3.
 * Therefore, in N hours, Chef can play N * 3 games.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= T <= 10
 * 1 <= N <= 10
 * The result will be at most 30, which fits comfortably in a standard integer.
