 * Problem Analysis:
 * Janmansh has 3 assignments, each taking 1 hour.
 * Total time required = 3 hours.
 * He must finish by 10 pm.
 * If he starts at X pm, he finishes at X + 3 pm.
 * Condition for completion: X + 3 <= 10, which simplifies to X <= 7.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= T <= 10
 * 1 <= X <= 9
 * Time complexity: O(T)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
