/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * We are given three shoes, each represented by 0 (left) or 1 (right).
 * We can go out if we have at least one left shoe (0) AND at least one right shoe (1).
 * 
 * Logic:
 * - If all shoes are 0 (0, 0, 0), we cannot go out.
 * - If all shoes are 1 (1, 1, 1), we cannot go out.
 * - Otherwise, we have at least one 0 and at least one 1, so we can go out.
 * 
 * This is equivalent to checking if the sum of A, B, and C is neither 0 nor 3.
