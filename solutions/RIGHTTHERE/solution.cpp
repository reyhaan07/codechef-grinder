/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef wants to host N people in a hall with capacity X.
 * The condition to host the party is that the number of people N 
 * must be less than or equal to the capacity X (N <= X).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= T <= 100
 * 1 <= N, X <= 10
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(T) - We process each test case in constant time.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - No extra data structures are used.
