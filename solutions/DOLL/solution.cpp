/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Gi-Hun and Ali have height K.
 * A player is visible if their height H_i <= K.
 * If a player has height H_i > K, they block the line of sight.
 * Therefore, we need to count how many players have height H_i > K.
 * These are the players who must be removed (shot).
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N) per test case, O(sum of N) total.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space (excluding input storage).
