/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * The number of trailing zeros in N! is determined by the number of times 
 * the factor 10 appears in the prime factorization of N!.
 * Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in any N!,
 * the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 appears 
 * as a factor in the prime factorization of N!.
 * 
 * According to Legendre's Formula, the exponent of a prime p in N! is:
 * E_p(N!) = floor(N/p) + floor(N/p^2) + floor(N/p^3) + ...
 * 
 * For p = 5:
 * Z(N) = floor(N/5) + floor(N/25) + floor(N/125) + ...
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(T * log5(N))
 * Given T = 100,000 and N = 10^9, log5(10^9) is approx 13.
 * Total operations approx 1.3 * 10^6, which easily fits within the 8s time limit.
