/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * The game ends when either Alice or Bob reaches 7 points.
 * Current scores are A and B.
 * Alice needs (7 - A) points to win.
 * Bob needs (7 - B) points to win.
 * The game ends as soon as one of them reaches 7.
 * Therefore, the minimum number of points remaining is the minimum of the points
 * needed by Alice and the points needed by Bob.
 * 
 * Points needed by Alice = 7 - A
 * Points needed by Bob = 7 - B
 * Result = min(7 - A, 7 - B)
